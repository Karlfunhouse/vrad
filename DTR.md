#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project?)

* Communication - Whatever we need to talk about is brought to the table - how we want to solve a problem.  Schedule updates as they come up.  

* Schedule - End by 7pm on weeknights, done on Fridays after retro.  Take 1 day off over the weekend.  (weather depending)

* POMs - 45 minutes of work/ 7 minute POMs.

* Stand Ups - What did we accomplish yesterday?  What do we want to accomplish today?  Is there anything preventing us to make the progress we want to make. What do we want to accomplish tomorrow to do preview.

* Project Expectations:
Edita - Get more comfortable with React - component based environment, router, testing.
Karl - Fetch, LifeCycle Methods, Testing

#### What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Deliver MVP.  Communicate throughout.  Improve our skillz in React & have a nice working app that we are proud of to put on our portfolio.  Both understand the whole codebase and stay on the same page throughout the project.  Going through the code to review and clarify what all the code is doing and explain it to each other.  


#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Edita - UI/UX Design, responsiveness, thinking outside the box with design, collaboration, Open mindedness to feedback and constructive criticism.
Karl - Collaboration/Paired Programming, feedback and openness to seeing other ways to do stuff.  Want to learn from my partner.  POM Patrol.  Asking questions when I'm confused or don't understand.

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Seems like we are on a pretty similar strength level so we will just check in to make sure we are both comfortable and able to overcome challenges together.  Documentation - Tutorials - Mentors

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
During all given class work time - 7pm on weekdays.  4pm on Fridays.  And then all day either Saturday/Sunday.  1 day off.
Go over what we will work on the next day to do preview of what we will get into the next day.  (Stand-ups) Find tutorials to both watch individually.

#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?
Slack vrad-superstars channel.  Any time we have work time (pre 7pm) be available.  Use Tuple to screen share & Pair.  If life stuff comes up just communicate.  If we need mid day sun breaks/outside just communicate and make up the time later.

#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Testing - Fetch - React in general - Routing - LifeCycle Methods - Anything else that we don't know we need to know.


#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Pair program drive/navigator and work through the project together.  If we see some divide and conquer opportunities we can designate them when we find them.  Each take time to try to solve a problem for ~20 minutes so we can be in our own individual processes.

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
* PR-Template for all PRs Review & Comment on code before merging.
* Emojis for commits

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Clear honest and open.  Constructive & Actionable criticism welcome.

#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
GitHub projects for Project Management

#### Day 1 Agenda:
* Wireframe
* DTR (check)
* GH Project Manager
* Share & Start Repo

#### Additional Notes:
We are gonna crush it!
